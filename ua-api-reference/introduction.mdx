## Universal Accounts SDK

The **Universal Accounts SDK** introduces a native implementation of **chain abstraction**â€”allowing developers to create and manage user accounts that work across multiple chains **with a single identity and balance.**.

This SDK abstracts away address management, transaction origin, and cross-chain user interaction, enabling developers to focus on product logic instead of multi-chain plumbing.

You can integrate it today using a simple SDK on web, with mobile and other environments coming soon.
